# Diffusion-model-for-cifar10-dataset

In this code, a classic small dataset, well known as ‘cifar10’, with 32x32 square images from 10 classes has been used to implement the idea of diffusion models on them. For the forward step, we used the reparameterization trick to add noise on original image as a function of time steps. Indicated below is the original image and noisy images in time steps 20, 40, 60 and 80.
